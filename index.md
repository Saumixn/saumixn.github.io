## Leadership Strategies

### Transformational Leadership
These types of Leaders serve as role models to inspire others. This type of leadership involves in improving the morale and job performance of the team by connecting with their identity and the collective identity. This type of leader is a visionary and motivates others in critical thinking and innovation. A transformational leader can also gain the trust and support of the people who follow them which in return changes peopleâ€™s behavior. This type of leader also rewards the team (promotions and vacations) when their good and punishes the team members (improvement programs and demotions) for poor behavior. 

In my opinion, A Transformational leader is visionary. He/She is responsible of motivating the team and critical thinking within the team. They should also come up with ideas so that it is competitive with all the innovative ideas that the world has come up with.
